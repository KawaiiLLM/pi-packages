# Retro: #664 — ESC (parent interrupt) aborts all background agents

## Stage: Triage (2026-07-27T21:44:53Z)

### Session summary

## 664 is a proposal from @daoguademeng (not a defect report) asking whether ESC aborting every background agent should become a policy setting rather than fixed behavior

It surfaced while reviewing that contributor's PR #665, and the operator opted to **accept the design and implement it in-repo ourselves** rather than take the contributor's existing patch.
The discussion also produced a mechanical trace of Pi's ESC handling, which ruled out a richer interactive design on ESC itself and spun out #676.

### Decision

**Implement `abortAllOnInterrupt` ourselves, taking the design as #664 specifies it:**

- `abortAllOnInterrupt` defaulting to **`true`**, so current behavior is preserved exactly on upgrade and no user's panic button changes.
  This keeps the change pure-addition and non-breaking.
- The policy predicate is consulted **at abort time**, not at wiring time, so a mid-session settings change applies immediately.
- Persisted alongside the existing numeric settings (`sanitize` + `snapshot` + layered load), toggleable from `/subagents:settings` as a direct flip with no input prompt.

The touch point is `InterruptHandler` (`src/handlers/interrupt.ts`), which latches the parent turn signal and calls `manager.abortAll()` when it fires.

#### Attribution and communication

**Do not comment on #664 until our work is delivered.**
The operator's explicit call: we say nothing now, and explain what we did once it ships.
The contributor has an implementation on their fork (`daoguademeng/pi-packages@feat/interrupt-abort-setting`, commit `fc45d4c`) which we are declining in favor of our own — that is a decision to explain at delivery, not to negotiate in advance.

The contributor gets credit regardless.
Every implementation and docs commit carries, after a blank line at the end of the body:

```text
Co-authored-by: daoguademeng <whumaple@gmail.com>
```

Open choice for the implementation session: whether to read the contributor's branch.
Reading it makes co-authorship unambiguous; not reading it keeps our implementation independent.
Either way the trailer goes on, since the design itself is theirs.

#### Why the richer ESC design is not reachable

The operator's instinct was that ESC is *ambiguous* when both the parent and background agents are running, and that the right answer is to ask — a menu offering "stop the main agent," "stop the background ones," "stop one," "stop everything," with repeated presses escalating toward stop-it-all.
That design is sound but cannot be built on ESC.
Verified against the pinned `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` 0.80.5, not just the `../pi` checkout:

1. `app.interrupt` sits in `RESERVED_KEYBINDINGS_FOR_EXTENSION_CONFLICTS` (with `app.clear`, `app.exit`, and others).
   `ExtensionRunner.getShortcuts()` skips a reserved binding with a warning, so `registerShortcut("escape", …)` silently does nothing.
2. The abort is **synchronous on the keypress call stack** — keypress → `CustomEditor.handleInput` → `onEscape` → `agent.abort()` → `runAbortController.abort()` — with no extension-visible hook in between.
3. There is **no `interrupt` or `abort` extension event**.
   `InterruptHandler` learns about ESC only by latching `ctx.signal` and listening for `abort`, which is a notification after the fact: the parent is already gone.

So a prompt at ESC time could never ask about the parent, because the parent is already dead.
This is correct behavior on Pi's part — an interceptable panic button is not a panic button.

Two further constraints worth remembering:

- **Double-ESC is already taken.**
  `settingsManager.getDoubleEscapeAction(): "fork" | "tree" | "none"` fires on two ESCs within 500 ms when the editor is empty.
  Mashing ESC already escalates today — into session navigation — which collides directly with any "mash to stop everything" scheme.
- `ui.onTerminalInput()` returns `{ consume?: boolean }` and *could* swallow ESC before the editor sees it.
  Rejected: it routes around Pi's reserved-key policy through a side door and would have this package seize the global interrupt key even when no subagents exist.

#### Follow-on

## 676 carries the reachable half of the operator's design: dedicated shortcuts we own, which fire *before* anything is aborted, so every outcome is still live

Agreed shape there is two keys — an immediate "stop all subagents" fast path plus a picker for one/all/everything — both configurable through the package's existing `loadLayeredSettings` config with defaults.

## 664 and #676 are independent and can land in either order

## 664 governs what ESC destroys by default; #676 governs whether the operator has a deliberate alternative to reaching for ESC at all

Unrelated to both: #674 tracks the queued-stop lifecycle defect from the same contributor's PR #665.

## Stage: Planning (2026-07-28T01:38:26Z)

### Session summary

Wrote `packages/pi-subagents/docs/plans/0664-abort-all-on-interrupt-policy-setting.md` on top of the triage decision: an `abortAllOnInterrupt` setting defaulting to `true`, a policy predicate consulted inside `InterruptHandler`'s abort listener, and a direct-flip toggle in `/subagents:settings`.
Four steps — persist the setting, gate the interrupt, add the toggle, document it — with the `Co-authored-by: daoguademeng <whumaple@gmail.com>` trailer required on every commit.
Release recommendation is ship independently: the issue is in no roadmap phase and the change is a self-contained additive `feat:`.

### Observations

- **Measurement that shaped the design.**
  Traced the abort paths rather than assuming: `spawnBackground` passes no `signal`, so `InterruptHandler` is the *only* thing that aborts a background agent on ESC; `runForeground` and the resume path both pass the tool's `signal` straight through to `Subagent.run()`'s `listeners.wireSignal`, so a foreground agent self-aborts on ESC regardless of the setting.
  The contributor's offered "scope it to background-only agents" variant is therefore already the effective behavior — no filtering needed in `abortAll()`.
- **Operator decisions taken at the `ask_user` gate.** (1) Keep the name `abortAllOnInterrupt` and document the foreground nuance in the README, rather than renaming to a background-explicit key. (2) Fold the boolean into `subagents-settings.ts`'s descriptor table as a `kind`-discriminated union (`numeric` | `toggle`) with one dispatch point, rather than a second table or an inline special case. (3) With the policy off, skip `abortAll()` entirely so queued agents are spared too — no "drop the queue, spare the running" variant.
- **Tell-Don't-Ask on the toggle.**
  The manager exposes `toggleAbortAllOnInterrupt()` and owns the negation; the UI descriptor never reads the boolean, negates it, and writes it back.
  Consequently no public setter and no `applyAbortAllOnInterrupt(value)` — a value-taking apply method would be dead code.
- **Predicate over settings object.**
  `InterruptHandler` takes a required `() => boolean`, matching `new ConcurrencyLimiter(() => settings.maxConcurrent)` in `index.ts`, so the handler never learns the settings key's name and the value is read at abort time.
  Required rather than defaulted so a future wiring site cannot silently opt out.
- **Open for the implementation session.**
  Whether to read the contributor's fork branch (`fc45d4c`); the plan recommends not reading it, since the design is fully specified here and the co-author trailer goes on regardless.
- No follow-up issues filed — everything deferred is already tracked by #676 (shortcut-driven stop UX) and #674 (queued-stop lifecycle).

## Stage: Implementation — TDD (2026-07-28T01:52:28Z)

### Session summary

Landed the `abortAllOnInterrupt` policy setting in four commits (one Tidy-First prep `refactor:`, three `feat:`), plus a `docs:` and a `style:` follow-up.
The pi-subagents suite went 1114 → 1134 tests (+20); root `check`, `lint`, `test`, and `fallow dead-code` are all green.
The plan was followed without deviation; every implementation and docs commit carries the `Co-authored-by: daoguademeng <whumaple@gmail.com>` trailer.

### Observations

- **Tidy-First earned its keep.**
  The `tidy-first-assessor` recommended exactly one preparatory commit — splitting the descriptor-shape refactor in `src/ui/subagents-settings.ts` out of the feature commit — and rejected four other candidates as scope creep (generalizing `sanitize()`'s numeric branches, restructuring `load()`, sharing the toast type across files, touching `interrupt.ts`/`index.ts`).
  Landing `SettingDescriptorBase`, the `kind` tags, the `NUMERIC_SETTINGS` → `SETTINGS` rename, the `SettingsToast` alias, and the `promptNumeric()` extraction first left the feature commit as a genuinely additive diff: one array entry, one interface variant, one early-return branch.
  The prep commit needed zero test changes, which verified it was behavior-preserving for free.
- **One judgment call against the assessor.**
  It suggested `handle()` dispatch on `descriptor.kind` in the prep commit with the `"toggle"` arm unreached; that is not expressible without the variant existing, and a one-member union alias would have been speculative.
  Settled on tagging `kind: "numeric"` and typing the array `readonly NumericSettingDescriptor[]`, then widening to the union in the feature commit.
- **Snapshot growth rippled predictably.**
  Adding a field to `snapshot()` broke seven existing full-object `toEqual` assertions across the `snapshot()` and `saveAndNotify()` blocks.
  Extended them in place rather than loosening to `toMatchObject`, so a dropped numeric field still fails loudly.
- **Policy read timing is pinned by four tests**, including one asserting the predicate is *not* consulted until the signal fires — the mid-session-toggle guarantee lives in a test, not just prose.
- **README structure needed a second pass.**
  The new `### Abort on interrupt` subsection initially landed between the Persistent Settings prose and its global-defaults example, orphaning the example under the wrong heading; moved it below the failure-behavior paragraph.
  Also updated the example's trailing sentence, which enumerated the example's keys.
- **Pre-completion reviewer: PASS.**
  One non-blocking nit — `abortAllOnInterrupt` landed between the `apply*` methods in `SubagentsSettingsManager` instead of with the other readonly properties; fixed in `d698de0b` (`style:`).
  The reviewer also noted pre-existing mock-typing drift in the two touched test files (`ReturnType<typeof vi.fn<Sig>>` rather than the `testing` skill's `Mock<Sig>`), which predates this issue and was left alone.

## Stage: Final Retrospective (2026-07-28T13:53:22Z)

### Session summary

Shipped `abortAllOnInterrupt` end to end across four stages (triage → planning → TDD → ship) as `pi-subagents-v19.2.0`, from a third-party proposal by @daoguademeng that the operator chose to implement in-repo with co-authorship credit.
Six commits: one Tidy-First `refactor:`, three `feat:`, one `docs:`, one reviewer-prompted `style:`; pi-subagents tests 1114 → 1134 (+20).
The defining moment was a planning-time code trace that changed the shape of the operator's decision rather than merely confirming the proposal.

### Observations

#### What went well

1. **A measurement reframed the design question.**
   The contributor offered "scope it to background-only agents" as an alternative shape.
   Tracing the abort paths (8 tool calls through `background-spawner.ts`, `agent-tool.ts`, `foreground-runner.ts`, `subagent.ts`, `run-listeners.ts`) established that background spawns pass **no** `signal` while foreground and resume paths pass the parent's run signal straight into `Subagent.run()`'s `listeners.wireSignal`.
   So background-only scoping was already the effective behavior, needing no filtering in `abortAll()`.
   That fact went into the pre-`ask_user` message as a concrete before/after, and it produced a third decision the issue never raised — whether to rename the key to match — which the operator answered directly.
   The `/plan-issue` discipline of "measure, don't argue" paid off at the point where it matters most: shaping the option set, not defending a plan.
2. **Tidy First earned its keep on its first application to this package's UI layer.**
   The `tidy-first-assessor` recommended exactly one preparatory commit and explicitly rejected four candidates as scope creep (generalizing `sanitize()`'s numeric branches, restructuring `load()`, sharing the toast type across files, touching `interrupt.ts`/`index.ts`).
   The prep commit `5397edef` needed **zero** test changes, which verified it behavior-preserving for free before the risk-bearing feature commit landed on top.
   The feature commit that followed was three small additions instead of a mixed refactor-plus-behavior diff.
3. **The `release_pr_merge` in-progress-check branch worked as written.**
   The PR came back `UNSTABLE`; the rollup had one check `IN_PROGRESS` rather than being empty.
   That is precisely the case `/ship-issue` step 6.4 distinguishes, and the correct path (wait with `gh pr checks --watch --fail-fast`, then retry `release_pr_merge`; do **not** fall back to `gh pr merge` while a check runs) was followed without improvisation.
   Worth recording because the earlier, simpler version of that rule would have merged through a running check.
4. **Cross-session context bridge held.**
   The triage stage entry carried the operator's direction decision, the co-authorship requirement, the rejected ESC-interception design, and the reasons — so the planning session did not re-litigate any of it and the `ask_user` gate could go straight to the genuinely open parameters.

#### What caused friction (agent side)

1. `other` (shell/zsh mechanics) — four compound `bash` calls died on a decorative `echo` separator: `echo ===` → `zsh:1: == not found`, `echo =====` twice, `echo =-=-=` → `zsh:1: -=-= not found`. zsh's `equals` expansion treats a word starting with `=` as a command-path lookup, so the separator I typed was never echoed — and because the separator sat in the middle of an `A; B; C` chain, the whole call had to be re-run.
   The same mistake recurred at three separate points in the planning stage after the first failure, which is the real signal: it never got encoded.
   Impact: 4 wasted tool calls, no rework to any deliverable.
2. `missing-context` — the `### Abort on interrupt` README subsection was inserted after the "Precedence" paragraph without first reading the full extent of the `## Persistent Settings` section, which orphaned the `**Example — global defaults**` block and its trailing sentence under the new heading.
   Caught by re-reading the rendered region, then fixed by relocating the subsection below the failure-behavior paragraph and updating the example's trailing sentence (which enumerates the example's keys).
   Impact: one extra read and one extra edit pass; caught before the commit, so committed history is clean.
3. `other` (minor) — `abortAllOnInterrupt` landed between the `apply*` methods in `SubagentsSettingsManager` rather than with the other readonly properties.
   The pre-completion reviewer caught it; fixed in `d698de0b`.
   Impact: one extra `style:` commit.
   Arguably the review gate working as designed rather than friction.

#### What caused friction (user side)

1. Nothing that cost this session anything.
   The triage session's decision record was unusually complete — it pre-answered direction, default, naming, attribution, and the rejected alternative, with the mechanical reasons ESC interception is unreachable.
   That is the pattern to keep for third-party proposals: decide direction in triage, then let `/plan-issue` spend its `ask_user` budget on parameters the operator has not already settled.
2. One small opportunity: the plan deferred "should the global-defaults README example include the new key?"
   to the docs step as an Open Question.
   Deciding it at docs time is what surfaced the section-structure slip above.
   A deferred doc-shape question is cheap to answer at planning time and would have had the section read in full before the edit.

### Diagnostic details

- **Model-performance correlation** — planning, TDD, and this retrospective ran on `anthropic/claude-opus-5` (judgment-heavy: design decisions, `ask_user` framing, test design); the ship stage ran on `anthropic/claude-sonnet-5` (mechanical: push, CI watch, release merge).
  Both subagents (`tidy-first-assessor`, `pre-completion-reviewer`) ran on `anthropic/claude-sonnet-5` per their frontmatter, and both produced substantive judgment — the assessor's four explicit scope-creep rejections and the reviewer's cross-step invariant check against #540 (plus `mmdc` parsing all five Mermaid diagrams).
  No mismatch in either direction.
- **Escalation-delay tracking** — no `rabbit-hole` friction points.
  The four zsh separator failures were single-call retries, not an escalation delay; the pattern is recurrence across the session, not persistence on one error.
- **Unused-tool detection** — `colgrep` was loaded but never used; correctly so, since every search was exact-symbol (`InterruptHandler`, `signal`, `spawnAndWait`, `wireSignal`), which the decision table assigns to `grep`.
  The 8-call signal-flow trace is a borderline `Explore` subagent candidate, but it ran in this package rather than the `../pi` checkout the `AGENTS.md` rule targets, and its output fed directly into the design — keeping it inline preserved the detail the `ask_user` message needed.
- **Feedback-loop gap analysis** — no gap.
  `pnpm run check` ran after every green step (five times) rather than only at the end, the full suite ran at the baseline and after the last step, and root `lint` plus `fallow dead-code` ran both before the final commits and again as pre-push gates.

### Changes made

1. `AGENTS.md` — added a zsh `equals`-expansion rule to `## Code Style`, beside the existing glob-quoting rule: do not start a bash word with `=`, since `echo ===` aborts the whole compound command.
2. `.pi/skills/markdown-conventions/SKILL.md` — added an `### Inserting a new section` rule: read the parent section end to end before inserting a new heading, because an insertion point that reads correctly at the seam can reparent a following example block or summary sentence.

Considered and rejected: a `code-design` rule on interface member ordering (over-specification for a one-line reviewer catch); encoding the abort-path measurement into `/plan-issue` (duplicates the existing measure-don't-argue rules); migrating the two touched test files to the `testing` skill's `Mock<Sig>` convention (pre-existing drift, separate cleanup); a rule about deferring doc-shape Open Questions (the section-insertion rule addresses the real failure mode).
